# ImageDecomposition-DECT
An image decomposition aloghrithm for Dual-energy Computed Tomography (DECT) based on deep learning.

The pre-trained model(FCN_trained_model) and training data(training_samples_90000.rar) can be download from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r1OTjid2muWWZfxURB8Pjw

The pre-trained model was trained on a dataset which contained totally 2,454,300 samples. Each sample is a 65*65 image patch extracted from 5987 image slices. We provide a sub-set (90,000 samples) in the 'training_samples_90000.rar' file.
